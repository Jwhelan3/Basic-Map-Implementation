# Basic Map Implementation (Generic Programming Demonstration)

This project implements a basic Map with the essential features, demonstrating an understanding of the implementation of data structures in object oriented programming. Generic programming is used in the Map class, enabling any data type (even custom-defined ones) to be used with the map. Allows a key-value pair to be inserted, deleted, updated and searched.

The use of the STL was avoided for the purpose of this exercise.
